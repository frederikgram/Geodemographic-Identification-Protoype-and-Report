# Innovation Project
### Data analysis platform allowing users to sort Danish municipalities by selecting a set of metrics from publically available data sources. 

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/frederikgram/Geodemographic_Identification/blob/master/example.jpg?raw=true)">

Say that a bussiness wanted to find the region which has the lowest population of elders, highest concentration of libertarian voters and greatest quantity of bowling alleys, this web-service ranks municipalicties by these properties using user-provided priorities for each metric, visualizing this as a heatmap of danish counties.


ðŸ“Œ It is highly recommended to read the [innovation.pdf](https://github.com/frederikgram/Geodemographic-Identification-Protoype-and-Report/blob/master/innovation.pdf) file, as this contains a detailed description of both the problem and the prototype itself.
